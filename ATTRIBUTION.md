# Attribution

Every asset bundled in this repository (images, icons, fonts, data files) is listed here with its
author, source and licence. `cargo xtask assets` fails if a file under `assets/` or
`docs/images/` is missing from this list.

FigCraft's user-interface icons are drawn in code (`crates/ui-egui/src/icons.rs`): original work,
MIT OR Apache-2.0. No third-party icon sets are used.

## Fonts (build input, not in this repository)

Release builds embed fonts from the optional craft-fonts build input
([storytold/craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR`). Its own
`ATTRIBUTION.md` and licence files are authoritative; the packages ship each font's licence.
